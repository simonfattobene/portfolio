		<h1 class="title" id="about-title">About me</h1>
		<p class="text-paragraph" id="texta">I am Simon, a geeky boy, that is just fascinated aboud bringing things into life.
			Since I can remember, I always stood upon problems that needed solutions, being the grandson of a blacksmith, I passed all of my childhood noons standing aside of my grandpa, just watching and asking questions, although most of the time his response was "you will see".
			It made me nervous but at the same time it made things much more interesting to me, I just wanted to know how things were done. <br><br>
		 	From the age of five, I adopted a nerdy lifestyle, playing games all day and learning interesting stuff on the net, it lasted at least another five years. <br><br>
		 	When I was about ten, I started developing my programming interests, I got into Minecraft and made servers with my friends, installing plugings and modifying them, lets be honest, at that point the only thing I knew about programming, was that if I modified a certain parameter of a document it would have an impact on the game server. <br><br>
		 	By the Age of twelve I had already been doing some video editing on Sony Vegas, and manipulations on Adobe Photoshop, but most importantly, I got my first real approach to programming. <br><br>
		 	A family friend that was actually a programmer saw something in me and he proposed to teach me about it. For a whole month he teached me about variables, functions and methods (OOP). He said to me that, it was the career of the future and I was excited, but sadly he died, he suffered cancer. From that moment I left programming, but kept my interests on computers.<br><br>
		 	At that point I started getting interested in competitive gaming, the mere difficulty of the things that those guys were achieving stucked into my brain.<br><br>
			Here I started gaming, firstly playing Counter Strike 1.6, but it was a bit too late for developing a career, the game was certainly dying, I played it until my fifteenth birthday.<br><br>
		 	That's about the time that my best friend comes in and shows me League Of Legends, a game that needed an incredible skill, but yet an astounding amount of knowledge and flawless decision making. I was freaking out.<br><br>
		 	For seven years I put more than 20,000 hours playing, analyzing and learning how to improve, I played for medium tier challenger teams, but life had other plans, so I left gaming and started helping with family bussines.<br><br>
		 	I have been working on my dad's gym, doing administrative tasks, collaborating within management decisions and bringing fresh ideas to the table. During this last two years, we doubled our income. But, I want some fresh air, so I'm taking this new road, willing to adopt the necessary tools to grow and innovate.</p>
