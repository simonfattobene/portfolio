		<h1 class="title" id="about-title">About me</h1>
		<p class="text-paragraph" id="texta">I'm Simon, a geeky boy with a passion for bringing things to life. Growing up alongside my blacksmith grandfather, I spent my childhood immersed in curiosity, always questioning and observing.
			By the age of five, I embraced a nerdy lifestyle, playing games and exploring the vast world of internet knowledge, an exploration that persists till this day. <br><br>
		 	Around ten, my interest shifted to programming through Minecraft, where I ventured into server management and basic modifications. By twelve, I delved into video editing and had my first exposure to programming with the guidance of a family friend, despite his unfortunate passing due to cancer.
			Although I temporarily left programming, my fascination with computers persisted. <br><br>
		 	Transitioning to competitive gaming, I initially explored Counter-Strike 1.6, but the timing was late for a gaming career. However, my fifteenth birthday marked a turning point when my best friend introduced me to League of Legends, a game demanding incredible skill and profound decision-making.
			This marked the beginning of seven years invested in gaming, playing for medium-tier challenger teams. <br><br>
		 	In the virtual realm of League of Legends, I honed skills that extended beyond the boundaries of the screen. The intense strategizing, teamwork, and split-second decision-making required in competitive play significantly enhanced my analytical and leadership abilities.
			Navigating through various roles within the game, I learned adaptability, a trait crucial not only in the gaming arena but also in real-world scenarios.
			The constant pursuit of improvement and the ability to stay calm under pressure became second nature during high-stakes matches, molding me into a resilient individual ready to face challenges head-on. <br><br>
		 	Life took a different turn, and I decided to work on my family's gym. Over the past two years, I've played a pivotal role in administrative tasks, collaborated on management decisions, introduced innovative ideas, and designed the brand style. This dedication resulted in doubling our gym's income.
			Seeking new challenges, I now embark on a journey to further enhance my skills, ready to embrace the tools needed for growth and innovation.</p>
